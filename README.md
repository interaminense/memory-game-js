# Memory Game JS

It is an online memory game with three difficulty levels: easy, medium and hard. The game includes a ranking scheme with the top 20 players on each level, where players can enter their names into the ranking at the end of the game.

The ranking is calculated based on the time, the amount of times the cards are flipped, and a bonus card that if found, adds 3 points to the player's final score.

The game also includes a cheat, where if the player correctly enters a Harry Potter spell, the cards are revealed, making the game much easier.
